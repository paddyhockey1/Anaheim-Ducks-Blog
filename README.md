## Future Features


* User Posts


In the future I would like to allow some users, with necessary permissions, to write their own posts that others can read and comment on.


* Forum Integration


The integration of a forum feature in the site would allow for users to engage in more detail than simply through the comments on each post.


* Users can Edit their own profiles


Users would be able to access their own profiles and edit them accordingly. The profile could contain more information about the user like an image and information on what date the user joimed and how many comments and posts they have contribute to the site


* Personal Social Media LInks


I would like to eventually create site specific social media accounts rather than the team's official sites that have links contained within the footer. These links could also be placed below each blog post so users could share not only the site in general but specific posts that they find informative.


* Topic Categorization


Future improvements could include a method to filter blog posts by category making locating them easier to both users and the site's administrators.


* Password Reset Email Notification


Should a user forget their password, there is no way currently for the user to reset their own personal email. A future addition could be that when a user forgets either their username or password, an automated email could be sent to their personal email, which would be added to their user profile with a reset link contained in the email.


* Contact and Message Page


A page within the site could be created where the user could contact the site's admin either through email or through a direct message that could be written within the site with no need for an external email address.
