<kbd>![social-media](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38e7d350-83ec-4286-9fc7-f75b6f6f47f1)</kbd>


Contained within the site's footer are links to the Ducks official accounts. These include: facebook, Instagram and Reddit. This allows users Direct links to the team's various social media sites.


* User Comments


<kbd>![comment-box](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01011a10-7601-44f5-81a3-1d4871a4fcc0)</kbd>


Once registered, users may comment on the posts contained within the site. Users must be approved before commenting and their individual comments must be approved by the relevent user to ensure their comments do not contain any inappropriate content. This moderation ensures every user feels welcome when visiting the site.


## Future Features


* User Posts


In the future I would like to allow some users, with necessary permissions, to write their own posts that others can read and comment on.


* Forum Integration


The integration of a forum feature in the site would allow for users to engage in more detail than simply through the comments on each post.


* Users can Edit their own profiles


Users would be able to access their own profiles and edit them accordingly. The profile could contain more information about the user like an image and information on what date the user joimed and how many comments and posts they have contribute to the site


* Personal Social Media LInks


I would like to eventually create site specific social media accounts rather than the team's official sites that have links contained within the footer. These links could also be placed below each blog post so users could share not only the site in general but specific posts that they find informative.


* Topic Categorization


Future improvements could include a method to filter blog posts by category making locating them easier to both users and the site's administrators.


* Password Reset Email Notification


Should a user forget their password, there is no way currently for the user to reset their own personal email. A future addition could be that when a user forgets either their username or password, an automated email could be sent to their personal email, which would be added to their user profile with a reset link contained in the email.


* Contact and Message Page


A page within the site could be created where the user could contact the site's admin either through email or through a direct message that could be written within the site with no need for an external email address.


## User Stories


<kbd>![user-stories](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ad71093-457a-479d-9701-336f7db39242)</kbd>


The project containing these user stories can be accessed [here](https://github.com/users/paddyhockey1/projects/32)


The purpose of this site ie to give Anaheim Ducks fans the option to learn more about the team through posts and comments. They can do so by registering with the site and it will give them access to a list of posts about the team.


The users also have the ability to edit and delete their comments while logged in to the site. The site also shows the latest stories that have been written by some of the site's users which can be easily navigated between and comment on them.


The user stories have been split between the user stories that have been completed and some that will hopefully be completed in the future but are currently incomplete.

## Model Design
